### Structure
The website has been presented in a User friendly and easily navigated way. On visting of the site you will be met with a pop up to tell you the rules and ways to win and also a text box for you to enter your name so the player score will be personal to the game player. When you enter the game section of the site, there is a score board to show who is winning the match between you and the computer. The 3 main icons on the page are Emoji hanmd shaped as rock, hand shaped as paper and lastly hand shaped like sciisors. The user chosses from these 3 option there choice of hand they want to use for each round. When the mouse pinter goes over the hands they will hover for effect. When the hand is chosen it will glow red for loser, green for winner and orange if it is a draw and also the text above the emoji hands will change to show result and go the same color as the result. The game is based on a first to five methoid. When either the Player or the Computer get to five wins a pop up will show the winner of the game and reset the scores to 0-0. There is also a reset game button below the emoji to allow the ability to reset the score to 0-0 at any time.

## Bugs and Future Works

- I had an issue with page responsivness with the PopUp box at page load. When the page dropped below the 1200px the Popup would start disappearing off the page at the top and would only show half of the content. The PopUp box is set to position:absolute and z-index:2 to appear above the game container. What i found is if i changed the margin top on the PopUp container it would push the game down to a viewable level. This was done from  1200px down to all screen sizes in the media section to allow a nice and functionable feayure.

- I had an issue with the Reset button positioniong on the page. This was showing up even when the pop up was visible and also clickable. This could confuse users and also as per PP2 criteria I can not have something distarcting in the background that can take away from normal usage. I created a function within the javaScript that when the popUp appears on page load. The Reset button would be set to Display:none in the CSS and would not be viewable to the user. Now when the user presses the "Lets Fight" button on the pop up page. This then triggers ther function and sets the button to Display: Block and fully usable as inteded.

- I had an error messages in the Console in the developer tools using the Chrome Browser. The error read "Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was recieved". This error would not come up in the consoloe straight away when loaded. It could take 5 minutes to pop up and sometimes it did not appear up at all. After some investigation I found online <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72494154/a-listener-indicated-an-asynchronous-response-by-returning-true-but-the-messag">Stack Overflow</a> that this error is caused by Google Chrome - "This is caused by Chrome Extensions making cross-origin requests. The Chrome Extensions should return true when fetching from cross-origins." I found if I opened the site in Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome Incognito mode the error did now not display. 

- I had an bug on the function to end the match when either the player or the compuiter reaches 5 wins. I had function set to when player or computer === 5 run alert message and reset game. I changed the the result to >= 5 and this allowed the game to run to 6 rounds which still was incoreect. After some time I started researching on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators">MDN Web docs</a> for a solution. I found that the "===" operator I was using was incorrect and should be "==". When the function was altered all worked as expected.

- When completing the Chrome developer Lighthouse testing. I was recieveing a low score in the SEO section. After reading the results causes in the Lighthouse Testing report it stated to include more details within the head of the HTML page giving description of what the page was for. I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">W3 Schools</a> Meta Tag information on how to improve this which in turn brought my score on the SEO up to acceptable level.

- In a future update I would like the pop up "Game Over" alert to be customised to a Popup to suit the site allow for continuity througout.

- In a future update I would like to add sounds effects to the Rock Paper and Scissors button presses so that each hand has a sound effect of a punch like in a fighter type game. Also when the game is over and either the player or Computer wins the sound effect would play with the noise of a cheering crowd.
